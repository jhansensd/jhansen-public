# jhansen-public - Algorithms and Data Structures Repository
This repository contains basic data structures and algorithms implementations as prepared for a Google Interview. Amongst some of the most fun in this process was creating the adjacency list graph. In it I was able to apply some cool algorithms such as topological sort, dijikstra's shortest path, and primm's minimum spanning tree. Enjoy the use of this code. It was created in the IntelliJ ide but I have not moved those files over yet because this is just the code in a publically viewable format only.

The following describes the project main directories and files:
* [Core Algorithms]https://github.com/jhansensd/jhansen-public/tree/master/algorithms/core - This is the core algorithms and data structures code directory. This contains the most up to date and complete view of the core code.
* [Firstpass Algorithms]https://github.com/jhansensd/jhansen-public/tree/master/algorithms/firstpass - This contains the original source code that was created.
* [Secondpass Algorithms]https://github.com/jhansensd/jhansen-public/tree/master/algorithms/secondpass - This contains a second pass at some of the algorithms and data structures.
