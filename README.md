Data structures and algorithms public repository.
This repository contains basic data structures and algorithms implementations. Amongst some of the most fun in this process was creating the adjacency list graph. In it I was able to apply some cool algorithms such as topological sort, dijikstra's shortest path, and primm's minimum spanning tree. Enjoy the use of this code. It was created in the IntelliJ ide but I have not moved those files over yet because this is just the code in a publically viewable format only.
