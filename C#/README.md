The C# version of the algorithms and data structures code has been written to eliminate syntax errors and use appropriate containers such as Lists instead of ArrayLists, or Math.Abs instead of Math.abs. For output Console.WriteLine() is used instead of System.Out.PrintLn() respectively.

This repository contains basic data structures and algorithms implementations as prepared for a Google Interview. This repo should help anyone interviewing at Google or who would like to look at basic algorithm implementations. Amongst some of the most fun in this process was creating the adjacency list graph. In it I was able to apply algorithms such as topological sort, Dijikstra's and Bellman Ford single source shortest path, Floyd Warshall all-pairs shortest path, and Primm's minimum spanning tree. Enjoy the use of this code. The below graph implementations support output in GraphViz dot format so that you can view the graphs in a visual tool. This works with both directed and undirected graphs. The below randomly generated weighted directed graph was generated by putting an alphabatized wordlist into a hash table and then randomly pulling a word out and inserting into each node.
